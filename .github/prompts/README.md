# Project Build Prompts

This directory contains the step-by-step prompts used to build the AI-Agent-Framework-Client WebUI. These prompts serve as documentation and allow the project to be restored or recreated using similar instructions.

## Purpose

The goal of storing these prompts is to:
1. Document the complete build process
2. Enable project restoration from this repository
3. Provide a reference for similar projects
4. Maintain a clear history of architectural decisions

## Prompt Files

- `step-01-initial-setup.md` - Initial project structure and basic React setup (historical)
- `step-02-api-testing-ui.md` - API testing interface implementation (historical)
- `step-03-project-management-ui.md` - Full project management WebUI with routing

## How to Use These Prompts

Each prompt file contains:
1. **Original Prompt**: The exact prompt given to create that feature
2. **Context**: What existed before this step
3. **Requirements**: Detailed requirements from the prompt
4. **Implementation Details**: What was actually built
5. **Validation**: How to verify the implementation

## Restoring the Project

To recreate this project from scratch:

1. Start with Step 01 - Initial Setup
2. Follow each step in sequence
3. Use the prompts as guidance for implementation
4. Validate at each step using the provided checklist

## Current State

The project is currently at **Step 3** with a complete project management WebUI including:
- Project listing and creation
- Project detail views
- Document change proposals
